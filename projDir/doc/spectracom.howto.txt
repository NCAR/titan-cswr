SPECTRACOM howto
================

1. Setting DHCP off
-------------------

On dow7 the IP is 192.168.0.204.
On dow6 the IP is 192.168.0.224.

Set this up via the front panel.

Hit X a few times to get to the top menu.

Hit checkmark to show top menu.

With arrows (down) select NetV4.

Hit checkmark.

Select eth0, hit checkmark.

Down arrow to DHCP.

Check that 'State = disabled'.

Otherwise cycle with checkmark until 'State = disabled', then apply.

2. Setting IP address
---------------------

Hit X to exit DHCP menu.

Go up, select IPADDR.

Then set IP to 192.169.0.204/24 for DOW7
            to 192.169.0.224/24 for DOW6

3. Set up remote ssh access
---------------------------

Bring up the Spectracom web page in Firefox.

In your browser, go to:

  ntp6 (on dow6)
  ntp7 (on dow7)

Confirm security exception in Firefox.

Log in:

  user: spadmin
  passwd: admin123

On newer systems, select: "Classic"

On main menu, select:

  Network -> HTTPS/SSH

Select:

  SSH tab

For:

  Public Keys File

select:

  Enabled

Then, paste in public key, and hit

  Submit

The unit will store the key, and then you should see the
key displayed.

4. Test remote ssh access.
--------------------------

From the command line, do:

  ssh spadmin@ntp6 (DOW6)
  ssh spadmin@ntp7 (DOW7)

and you should get straight in.

5. Setting to mobile mode
-------------------------

On newer systems, select: "Classic"

(a) Select Setup -> Inputs

(b) Select On-board reference GPS (at the right)

(c) Set:

  Receiver mode: Mobile
  Dynamics:      Land

and then click submit.

6. Bringing up the spectracom unit.
-----------------------------------

You can do this from a web browser, from mgen or drx.

The url is just 'ntp' and that should get you to the login screen.

User is spadmin, password is admin123.

You will notice that it takes the NTP status (on the front panel)
about 2 to 3 mins to reach 'strat = 1' - i.e. stratum 1, meaning that
is is sync'd with GPS. I think when it reaches that state the time
system is probably good to go.

You will notice that the 10 MHz oscillator reference takes longer to
settle down - it goes through various stages. Once the oscillator is
ready and accurate, the fault light will go off.

As an aside, it is worth making sure the NTP time on mgen and drx are
accurate before starting up. You can do this with:

  sudo fix_time

and it should show how close you are when it is done. The values are
in millisecs.
