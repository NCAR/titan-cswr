Making and restoring from tar backups
======================================

TITAN setup in DOW trucks

Making backups
--------------

You tar up the cvs directory, into the backups dir.

For example, on mgen7:

cd
mkdir -p backups
tar cvfz backups/mgen7.cvs.20160501.tgz cvs

Or on rapid dow drx:

cd
mkdir -p backups
tar cvfz backups/drxr.cvs.20160501.tgz cvs

Restoring from backups
----------------------

First copy the backup into the backups dir.
For example:

cd
mkdir -p backups
cp mgen6.cvs.20160501.tgz backups

The restore from it. For example

cd
mv cvs old.cvs
tar xvfz backups/mgen6.cvs.20160501.tgz

This will create a new cvs directory.

Configuring the host after restoring
------------------------------------

cd
cd cvs/projects/titan/dow/dualprt/system/scripts
./configure_host

NOTE: before running configure_host, make sure that /data exists, and is writeable by titan5.
